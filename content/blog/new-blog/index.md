So, I've decided to start a __blog__!.

From time to time, I'd have liked to have a place where to __sort and review my ideas__, or
the new things I learn. Now, I've no excuses to write a blog post every time I learn
something that is worth sharing :P

On another note, I better start __practising my english__ writing skills or I'll never
be close to a decent production level.

In summary, you can expect me to write about:

* C++/Python
* Vim (A lot of Vim)
* Computer Graphics
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Random thoughs

And much more (Or at least, that's what I hope)

Thats all for now, see you!
